# Issues with Nestlé

I don't mention this publicly very often, as it isn't related to technology, but it is a serious issue. Nestlé is a evil monopoly that I have been having growing hatred for since 2020 (upon research) I hate Google a lot, but I feel that Nestlé is over 2x more evil than Google, since Google isn't directly murdering people.

Nestlé has many severe, horrible, unhuman issues, such as stealing water and reselling it for a huge profit from all around the world (including places with ongoing droughts) claiming that water isn't a human right, using slavery to farm chocolate, intentionally poisioning millions of babies (Gerber) and contributing to a huge brain damage problem for the next generation, harassing pregnant mothers and hurting their babies with bad lies, buying up all the brands and becoming more inescapable, and much more.

Unfortunately, there is very little that I can eat/drink, so cutting options isn't an option for me, as I can't replace it. I already don't drink bottled water, I feel that the reason why I hate drinking water so much throughout the years is due to whatever Nestlé does to it. Thanks to them, I rarely consume pure water (other than water included in other foods and drinks) as of February 11th 2021, it has been over 2 months since I have drank water with nothing added.

I have a guilt for continuing to drink chocolate milk, as I know Nestlé used slavery to make it. I have been avoiding it when I can lately.

If you are capable of using Reddit, there is a community dedicated to hating Nestlé (https://www.reddit.com/r/fucknestle/) 

You should raise awareness about this issue, and try to avoid as many products as you can. No company is too big to fail, Nestle can be abolished.

**Note: when searching for sources, it was appauling to see how many different domains Nestle was using to try and hide their criticism. This is severe search engine manipulation, even on DuckDuckGo. That's another problem. I had to go through at least 6 pages to find less than 5 articles **NOT** by Nestle**

**More sources are needed**
