# Going vegetarian again

I have decided to go vegetarian again, as I was again reminded of how barbaric the agricultural process is and how bad it is for the environment. I would go vegan, but I feel like that would be impossible for me. At least if I do this, it will have some effect.

The following items will be cut from my diet:

1. Beef jerky

2. Chicken McNuggets

3. Wendys Chicken Nuggets

4. Cheeseburger bigbites

5. Beef hot dogs

6. Pork bacon

I hope to make this a permanent change this time. I have become a lot more ambitious and outgoing since my last attempt, so it should be a lot easier.
