# Version 2.02 - October 20th 2020 update

## V2.02

### About

This is a complete archive of the local version of my Food Index project. I have published this release 1 day late, with all the changes made in the 8+ hour development time yesterday.

In this release, I worked on rewriting the entire Google Sites version with all the original data by hand in HTML. I wanted to finish on the first day, but some got left over, and I had to save work for the next day.
